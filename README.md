<h1>About</h1>
I love taking on new challenges.

I have been exposed to various fields such as sound, design, and video.

I have design experience so I have an understanding of screen layers.


Services exist for the users.

I believe that the improvements that users need are the goal of all services.

As a developer, I create living services.


I prefer precise problem solving.

When an issue occurs, we try to accurately identify the cause and resolve it.

I believe that it is a developer's virtue to overcome business problems and find solutions.

We will solve any problem by adding solutions and removing unnecessary ones.

    <li>Project production and automatic improvement of existing CS manual programs, and event hosting to provide lower usage costs compared to competitors -> Increased user convenience and secured competitiveness</li>
    <li>Acquire customers who moved from competitors to your CMS program (20+, steadily increasing)</li>
    <li>The customer unit price is too low compared to the program's operating cost, so many customers are needed to secure actual profits.</li>

    <li>The existing React.js project structure was fragmented.</li>
    <li>We decided to start a new project with Next.js because we thought the cost of improving an existing project was higher than the cost of starting a new project.</li>
    <li>The existing multi-repo structure was changed to a mono-repo, and the project structure was created to support front/back integration type using Prisma in Next.js, making the project distribution by personnel clearer.</li>
    <li>Clear distribution of work by functional unit per person enables rapid development -> By clearly distributing work by person with Jira, time lost in the middle is minimized, and those who quickly complete work can receive the next work more quickly, improving work efficiency.</li>
    <li>However, the migration to Next.js cost more than we had calculated (3 months delay)</li>

    <li>In order to have a competitive edge over other goods sales sites such as Maple, it is necessary to secure and analyze data, and each creator needs an administrator function.</li>
    <li>Create a studio page, configure it so that each creator can manage their own settlement information, and provide weekly/monthly/minute/yearly statistics.</li>
    <li>The results of goods sales are confirmed visually and settlement becomes clear -> goods that the creator judges to have sold well are used for new projects -> sales increase</li>
